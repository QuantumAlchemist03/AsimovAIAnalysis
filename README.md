# 🧠 AI Systems and Intelligent Agents

This repository is a curated portfolio of intelligent systems implemented in C#. It showcases core AI concepts across five diverse projects, including symbolic AI, fuzzy logic, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.

## 🚀 Projects Overview

### 1. 🧾 Ex2_Turing – Turing Machine Simulator
Simulates the behavior of a Turing Machine with user-defined states and transitions. Includes a GUI editor to build and run machines that process symbolic input on an infinite tape.

- Concepts: Automata Theory, Computational Models
- Tech: C#, Windows Forms

### 2. ✈️ Flying Rules – Rule-Based Expert System
A symbolic AI system that uses logical rules to infer whether entities (e.g., birds) can perform actions like flying based on known attributes.

- Concepts: Rule-Based Inference, Forward/Backward Chaining
- Tech: C#

### 3. 🎯 Fuzzy – Fuzzy Logic Controller
Implements fuzzy logic principles to control decision-making in uncertain environments. Demonstrates fuzzy sets, membership functions, and inference.

- Concepts: Fuzzy Logic, Control Systems
- Output: `ammofuzzy.exe` simulation

### 4. 📚 NLP – Text Analysis Tool
Performs basic natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, word frequency analysis, and text statistics. Ideal for text mining demos.

- Concepts: Tokenization, Text Mining, NLP Fundamentals
- Output: `Textanalyser.exe`

### 5. 🧠 QLearningRoom – Reinforcement Learning Agent
A simple environment where an agent uses Q-learning to find optimal paths through trial-and-error. Learns using reward-based feedback.

- Concepts: Reinforcement Learning, Q-Table, Exploration vs. Exploitation
- Output: `Qlearning.exe`
